## make_seqs() is the meat of this script. This function uses Biopython to create an
## index dict of the fastaWithAlleles file where keys are the header lines and 
## values are the sequence.
## Use the method mutable_seq() to change a seq_record to a data type that can be mutated.
## (To preserve integrity, you can't mutate most seq items in Biopython. You have to
## make it a specific mutable object.)
## Once the mutable_seq is made, use it to create the WT and MUT alleles, as needed.
## I also count how many times the WT allele matches the ref and/or the MUT, for my records.
## Finally, the mutated seq (WT or MUT) are associated with thier ID and added to either
## the WT or MUT dictionaries. These dicts are passed to the next function, find_motifs().
